# To do
游댮游리游릭

* 游릭 change cli
    * 游릭 rename `blender` command to `run`
    * 游릭 add args to `run` override args provided to blender exe
* 游릭 detect existing venv (or .venv)
    * 游릭 ask user during create if they want to use it or abort or ignore
    * 游릭 set `PTHONPATH` env var
* 游릭 remove typer dependency, rewrite w `argparse`
* 游릭 tests
    * 游릭 cli
    * 游릭 create / setup env
    * 游릭 run blender
* 游릭 version command that prints versions of python, blenv, .blenv.yaml file, blender exe, and blender's python version
* 游릭 pypi does not have the readme as the project description
    * likely because the pyproject.toml file is referencing the file with the wrong path, the build system is unable to access files in a parent directory, so the `blender-env` folder should be removed and the project moved up a level so it can reference the readme correctly
* 游댮 emit warning if python and blender python's version don't match
    * 游댮 also emit warning when setting up blenv if mismatch is detected, ask for user confirmation to continue/abort
* 游댮 remove pydantic dependency (convert to dataclasses)
