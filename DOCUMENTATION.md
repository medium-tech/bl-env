[blenv.yaml](#blenvyaml)

[command line](#cli)

## Getting started
Blenv can be installed in your system python or project's venv.

    pip install blenv

Create blenv for current project

    python -m blenv create 

This creates a blenv environment which is a `.blenv.yaml`, a `.env` file and also a `.blenv` directory that mimics blender's [directory layout](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/advanced/blender_directory_layout.html). The `.blenv.yaml` file defines the project (addon vs. app template) and various environments or commands. The above command emits a placeholder that the developer will need to fill out to match their project's directory layout.

empty blenv.yaml file:

    blenv:
        version: '1'
    environments:
        default:
            blender: /Applications/Blender.app/Contents/MacOS/Blender
            env_file: .env
    project:
        addons: {}
        app_templates: {}

In the following example we define our project which defines an addon under `project` and then it's added to the `default` environment under it's `addons`. 

    blenv:
        version: '1'

    environments:
        default:
            blender: /Applications/Blender.app/Contents/MacOS/Blender
            env_file: .env
            addons:
            - object_cursor_array

    project:
        addons:
            object_cursor_array:
            source: 'src/object_cursor_array'

After configuring the project, run the following to set it up:

    python -m blenv setup

The setup command creates symlinks in the virtual blender environment (the local `.blenv` folder) and the addon's source path defined above `src/object_cursor_array`.

Then when the developer runs:

    python -m blenv blender

It will run blender and load the user's addon. This enables a quick and easy dev environment setups that would otherwise require custom scripts or using blender's directory structure that could be shared with all of the developer's other projects.


More technically, the above command calls the binary listed in `blender` under the `default` environment, it will use the `.env` file which overrides the blender's directory structure to use the `.blenv` folder created with the blenv cli tool. The `setup` command created a link in the addon folder under the `.blenv` virtual blender environment. When running blender the addon is passed to the cli's `addons` option. An environment can define addons, app templates, run a python script, or configure many other blender cli options. A developer can setup multiple environments that use different blender versions, run tests, open a specific blend file and more.

## blenv.yaml

The `blenv.yaml` file contains 1 or more blender environments. Each environment is a top level attribute which is the name of the environment when using the cli. Each environment contains the following options:


| blenv.yaml | blender cli arg | type | description | default |
| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| `inherit` | N/A | `str` / `null` | if not `null`, a `str` of the name of another blenv in this file, this blenv will be a duplicate of the parent with the remaining options overriding parent or default values | `null` |
| `blender` | N/A | `str` / `null` | path to blender binary, if `null` then `inherit` must define a parent that defines this value | The default value is system dependent, blenv will attempt to detect your installed blender by looking for common paths, if none are found a fallback of `blender` is used, if not defined your environment you will need to update this value manually to reference your blender executable |
| `env_file` | N/A | `str` / `null` | which env file to use, if `null` then `inherit` must define a parent that defines this value  | `.env` |
| `env_inherit` | N/A | `bool` | If `true` the blender process will have access to the system environment | `true` |
| `env_override` | N/A | `bool` | if `env_inherit` is `true` and this is `true` then the values from the `env_file` file will override system values | `true` |
| `args` | N/A | `list[str]` / `null` | launch blender with `blender` prepended to these arguments, ignores all other options that set a blender cli argument | `null` |
| `background` | `--background` | `bool` | If `true`, supply the blender arg to run blender in the background (headless / no ui) | `false` |
| `autoexec` | `--enable-autoexec` | `bool` | if `true`, supply the blender arg to enable automatic Python script execution | `false` |
| `app_template` | `--app-template` | `str` | if given supply app template cli option to blender | `null`
| `python` | `--python` | `str` | Run the given Python script file | `null` |
| `python_text` | `--python-text` | `str` | Run the given Python script text block | `null` |
| `python_expr` | `--python-expr` | `str` | Run the given expression as a Python script | `null` |
| `python_console` | `--python-console` | `bool` | Run Blender with an interactive console. | `false` |
| `python_exit_code` | `--python-exit-code` | `int` | If non-negative supply this vallue to the `--python-exit-code` arg, which sets the exit-code in [0..255] to exit if a Python exception is raised (only for scripts executed from the command line), zero disables. | `-1` |
| `python_use_system_env`  | `--python-use-system-env`| `bool` | Allow Python to use system environment variables such as PYTHONPATH and the user site-packages directory. | `false` |
| `addons` | `--addons` | `list[str]` / `null` | Supply addons to enable in addition to default addons, the blender cli accepts a csv delimited string, but `blenv.yaml` takes a list of strings. | `null` |
| `blender_file` | N/A | `str` | path to a `.blend` file to open | `null` |

## cli

**create**  - create a new blender environment in current directory

    python -m blenv create                                                                                                  

**setup** - setup blender environment in current directory, this is run during create, but can be run separately if a new app temnplate or addon is added to the environment and needs to be linked to the env. 
    
    python -m blenv setup     

**blender** - run blender with specified environment, or default environment if not specified

    python -m blenv blender   

blender stdout is redirected to your terminal. If you `Ctl+C` in the terminal one time it will terminate the blender process and restart it, effectively reloading your application. If you use `Ctl+C` twice quickly it will terminate blender and then exit
